# Water Quality Monitoring System with Arduino

This project used an Arduino to measure and display multiple readings such as temperature, voltage, and concentration of salt in water (PPM) when the probe is placed in water. The data is presented on a 16x2 LCD screen. The reason for creating this project was to compete in a competition called the Science Olympiad, where I was assigned a topic called detector building. I later modified the code, adding the temperature sensor for a science fair competition, where I won first place. The temperature sensor still needs to be fully fixed. To measure the data, I made a probe that was constructed by hot-gluing four Jumper wires onto a BIC pen.
